            I was 3 years old when I was introduced to the My Little Pony franchise. I don't really remember those times, most of the information is either taken from my parents, or from my diary, which I started keeping when I was 5, when I started learning to sit at the computer. But I will tell you how I know, one day my dad bought a video player from his boss, and a box with a few CDs, there were different movies, I remember karaoke, and a couple of cartoons. The boss had a daughter, so the cartoons were girlish, so I started with The Lion King, the Duck Tales, some episodes of Mickey Mouse, and towards the end I had nothing to watch and I found a dirty box of My Little Pony. And I inserted the disk into the drive, and I started watching, and I didn't understand what they were talking about, and I was hiding it from my parents and so on. But I liked it enough, I watched all the Pony Tiles and I had no other disks, but I saw that we still have one Pony and Friends disk for sale in the stores, and I wanted to buy it, I couldn't ask my parents, so I started to earn money like I could, I was given some money for helping out around the house, just for chewing gum and stuff like that. But I started saving, for about two weeks I had to actually do everything around the house to save up for a CD, and I did that, ran to the store, asked for a CD and they sold it to me. I watched episode after episode, and it was then in the last 44 episodes that I noticed the first Twilight in my life, but it wasn't Twilight. I understood these characters, they finally introduced the Russian language and I was happy.  I watched Midnight Castle and Escape from Catrina the same way. So it lasted until I was 5 years old and because my mom was starting to get into 1st grade I got into her class. Then for the new year I got the mlp g3 CD, new artwork, new graphics, I liked it but the characters were different... 2nd,3rd,4th grade, 2008...2009...2010!

            <strong>2011</strong> - And so I came out of school after after school and after walking a few streets, I realized that they were waiting for me, there were two of them, as it turned out later they were 15 years old, knocked down quite tall, ordinary yard boys, I walked and did not pay attention to them, and like already passed them, but apparently they decided to avenge their brother, from my thoughts I brought the first blow, I ... I couldn't fight back, I'm really 8 years old and they're 15, two bulls, I'm short and... I never developed any physio.  The second punch, I fell down, they started kicking me, on my head on my stomach, I tried to block, tears, pain, confusion. And then it stopped, one picked me up and leaned me against the wall and--and said to me:
            "Pray" and then I felt a cold piece of metal on my neck, with its thin tip pressing harder and harder. I was instantly aware of the whole situation... I was plunged into a rigid reflection... What could I do? Pray? No... Beg? No, that's what they want, a lot of things were flying around in my head, I imagined myself as an action movie hero, taking out one by one... but I wasn't stupid, I knew I wasn't a hero, I just... I'm just a punk-ass motherfucker up against the wall. I had a lot of thoughts flying around in my head, a kiloton of information, moments, events... Until all at once it just stopped... Twilight. Twilight? I didn't understand myself at the time, what the fuck does Twilight have to do with it? I didn't get it yet... Twilight had nothing to do with it, it wasn't Twilight I wanted, it was the way, the spark... the light... And then I found it... As in death people see a bright light at the end of the tunnel... I felt it, I felt it... I saw, a faint twilight mother light no matter how ridiculous it sounds... I found what I had been missing all my life, I found my way, I found my twilight light in my soul... And Twilight... or my subconscious, a pleasant gentle voice echoed in my head... It wasn't Tara's voice or Rebecca's voice, it was Twilight's voice... I knew it right away... I heard "You can't..." you can't.... Yeah I can't... And then I was back in the real world.
            "Are you silent bitch? Should I press harder?"
            The tears were gone, the thoughts were gone, the fear was gone... Everything was gone. I looked him in the eye and said: "Yes. You can't"... The expression on his face changed, he let me go and I fell down, he patted his friend on the shoulder and they left, I don't know why and I've never wondered... but afterwards I looked at my hands, blood, sharp pain, but it didn't matter to me. Pain and unconsciousness ... After I understand that they found me, took me to the hospital and ... As I was told I was lucky, the knife didn't hit any vital points on my neck, it just cut the skin itself, and he just strangled me with the knife. I had the cut stitched up, although it wasn't really necessary, and after a few days I was discharged... I came home a completely different person. I started reading books, I started studying Twilight hard in every aspect of her, I read a bunch of theories about her, a bunch of comics, etc. I started studying our world, I started to study Twilight hard in every aspect of her, I read a bunch of theories about her, a bunch of comics, etc. I began to study our world, I began to study my surroundings, a kiloton of information. I realized it was a game... and only he who plays it wins, I used concepts and about rebellious lifestyle was able to elevate myself to a higher caste, I changed people like a snap of my fingers, but never abandoned others. I saw good people at the social bottom and tried to get them out of there, I befriended and helped them, they slowly attached themselves to my friends, and that's how I created my society. We stood up for people who were humiliated, I stood up to groups of assholes who were beating one up... I once even stood up for a girl who was being beaten up by the same girls, they didn't share a boyfriend but... I tried to stop them with diplomacy, but this is the real world and I used force, I pushed one girl and she fell down... They called me names and swore at me and left... But the light told me that I did the right thing... even though I didn't think I was right... I went up to the girl... Masha and gave her my hand. And in her eyes I saw... I saw myself in the past... She got up and hugged me and I walked her home... I respected and appreciated Twilight, I read a bunch of books, I studied her, I started doing her habits of keeping always checklists, learning by cards. I studied her psychology .... Yeah I even got to the point where I started getting just as worried about other people's opinions as Twilight did, I started having the same psychological problems as Twilight... and... I tried to fight them, just like Twilight did, but... I'm just... I'm just Twilight, even though I don't like that word... From that moment on I was happy, always and everywhere, I was very proud and I cried when Twilight got her wings... Twilight really deserved it, Twilight did everything for it, she saved Equestria... She saved me... She made me who I am, and the twilight light showed me what to do... I'm grateful to her for everything... For everything I have. And for the new, full me...  I'll always be grateful to you Twilight, and even though you don't exist... and even though you're just a cartoon and an ad for plastic ponies... I have you in my heart... and always have been...
